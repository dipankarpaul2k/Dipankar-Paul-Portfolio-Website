          I design and develop user interfaces that are not only visually
          appealing but also functional and user-friendly. My skills in frontend
          technologies allow me to create responsive websites and web
          applications that work seamlessly across devices. I also enjoy sharing
          my knowledge and insights through my blogs on dev.to, where I write
          about Rust tutorials.

        <Text size="lg">
          I'm passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with the
          latest trends and technologies in the frontend development space. I
          approach each project with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering
          high-quality results. Additionally, I'm currently expanding my skills
          into backend development, broadening my expertise in creating
          full-stack applications.
